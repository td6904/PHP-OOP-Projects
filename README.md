## About

This repository contains OOP projects with PHP. Copied during the time I was studying PHP, my first coding language at the Wild Code School in Lille, France from September 2022 to December 2022. 

I didn't make much progress but will keep it for practice exercises to come back to. None of the little projects are functional so far.
